#COSC343 Genetic Algorithm
Simulation of creatures that roam the world trying to surving eatting strawberries.
Implementation:
Created a genetic algorithm that utilized tournament selection, single-point crossover, and random mutation.
The agent function contains a one hot encoded array of percepts(monster, creature, food, empty) that maps to the creatures chromosome.
