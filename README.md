A collection of my personal work, findings, and learnings on the subject of Artificial Intelligence. My hope is this to be place that shows my trail and tribulations in this complicated space. There is much to learn, and a library to be filled.

### COSC343 Genetic Algorithm

Simulation of creatures that roam the world trying to surving eatting strawberries.
Implementation:
Created a genetic algorithm that utilized tournament selection, single-point crossover, and random mutation.
The agent function contains a one hot encoded array of percepts(monster, creature, food, empty) that maps to the creatures chromosome.
