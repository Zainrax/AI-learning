# AI-learning
## Outline
A collection of my personal work, findings, and learnings on the subject of Artificial Intelligence. My hope is this to be place that shows my trail and tribulations in this complicated space. There is much to learn, and a library to be filled.


## Projects
### [COSC343 Genetic Algorithm](COSC343-World)

Simulation of creatures that roam the world trying to surving eatting strawberries.
#### Implementation:
Genetic algorithm:
- tournament selection 
- single-point crossover
- random mutation

Agent function
- one hot encoded for percepts(monster, creature, food, empty) 
- matrix multiplication and suming to map to actions

#### Challanges:
The learning process was a walk in the dark. I would stumble on one way of doing something, and the next couple trails lead me in a different direction. This was the first genetic algorithm I've implemented so all of it was new to me other than some machine learning concepts which I vaguely understood before.
